# CodeBnB Coming Soon Site Strategy

## Overview

The coming soon site serves as our initial public face while we build the platform. It's designed to generate interest, collect early user signups, and establish credibility before launch.

## Strategic Purpose

### Why a Coming Soon Site?
1. **Build anticipation** before the platform is ready
2. **Collect email addresses** from interested developers
3. **Validate market demand** through signup metrics
4. **Create social proof** through GitHub activity
5. **Establish credibility** with security-first messaging
6. **Generate founding members** with lifetime free offer

### Competitive Advantage
- **First impression matters**: Professional site vs empty marketplace
- **Early community**: Engaged users before competitors notice
- **Quality signups**: Developers who care enough to sign up early
- **Feedback opportunity**: Shape platform based on early interest
