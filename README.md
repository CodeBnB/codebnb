# Code Marketplace

A modern, developer-friendly marketplace for code, scripts, themes, and digital assets.

## Vision

Create a fair, transparent, and efficient platform that serves the developer community with:
- **1% transaction fees** (pay-per-success model)
- **No buyer fees** (transparent pricing)
- **Developer-first experience** (clean, fast, reliable)
- **Free listings** (no upfront costs)

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **Early Development Phase** - Currently planning and designing the core platform.

## Documentation

- [Full Project Documentation](./docs/project-documentation.md)
- [Security Framework](./docs/security-framework.md) ðŸ”’
- [Technical Architecture](./docs/architecture.md) (Coming Soon)
- [API Documentation](./docs/api.md) (Coming Soon)

## Security-First Approach

ðŸ”’ **This project implements security from day one**, not as an afterthought.

- **Credential separation**: Template-based config system (never commit secrets)
- **Secure deployment**: Automated deployment with permission management
- **Environment isolation**: Separate dev/staging/production configurations
- **Payment security**: Stripe integration with webhook verification
- **Database security**: Limited-privilege users and connection pooling
- **API security**: JWT authentication with rate limiting

See our [Security Framework](./docs/security-framework.md) for complete details.
